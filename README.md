# Onboarding

Let's go through some important onboarding information.

## Student Handbook

You should have received a link to our student handbook. Please sign it online ASAP! Let us know if you can't find the link.
 
## Github

Github will soon be one of your most important social media profiles. It will be like a portfolio for others to see you work.

Be professional. Make your username something appropriate and include your full name in your profile. It will also help us when working with you! Including a photo as well will help us out too.

## Blogging

We <3 blogging. It's important to showcase what you're learning and teach others at the same time. Teaching is one of the best ways to learn something, and blogging is a great way to teach! It also shows your involvement in the community by contributing knowledge. 

Have your blog on any platform that suits you, but if you're already blogging personally, we recommend keeping your technical blog separate. But use your best judgment.

Some platforms we like: [Tumblr](https://www.tumblr.com/), [Github Pages](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/01/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/), and [Ghost](https://ghost.org/).

Once the semester gets going, we'll create a schedule about when your blog posts are due.

It can be about what you're learning, a technical challenge you overcome, a walkthrough of something you were initially confused by, a side project you may be working on, any cool tips you've learned about anything technical, etc.

Every morning we'll have standups with the class and if you have a blog post due, you'll present it.

## Getting Help

When you're learning together during the day, you should be working on labs together and asking each other questions. 
If you're stuck, try to work out a problem on your own. We guarantee that someone else has had a similar problem or question and you can most likely find an answer on Stack Overflow. It's super important to become self-sufficient in figuring out problems and there's incredible learning moments in that.

Yet of course we're here to help and want you to reach out if you're stuck. It sometimes makes more sense to reach out, like if there's a bug in a lab or you've been stuck for a long time.  We'll be using Learn.co to respond to any questions you might have relating to any labs.  When logged into Learn, you will see the **ASK A QUESTION** buton in the top right next to your profile image where you can ask your question.  Please use this as the exclusive method of communicating questions: we gather data with it that's super helpful for us when working on curriculum and thinking about points of confusion in our material.
