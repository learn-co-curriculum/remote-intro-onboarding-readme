# Onboarding

Let's go through some important onboarding information.

## Student Handbook

student handbook (would have to be changed for remote) must be signed before access to ironboard class
 - expectations (timing, effort)
 - must finish the prework beforehand

## Github

Github will soon be one of your most important social media profiles. It will be like a portfolio for others to see you work.

Be professional. Make your username something appropriate and include your full name in your profile. It will also help us when working with you! Including a photo as well will help us out too.

## Blogging

We <3 blogging. It's important to showcase what you're learning and teach others at the same time. Teaching is one of the best ways to learn something, and blogging is a great way to teach! It also shows your involvement in the community by contributing knowledge. 

Have your blog on any platform that suits you, but if you're already blogging personally, we recommend keeping your technical blog separate. But use your best judgment.

Some platforms we like: [Tumblr](https://www.tumblr.com/), [Github Pages](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/01/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/), and [Ghost](https://ghost.org/).

You need to write **one blog post a month**. Once the semester gets going, we'll create a schedule about when your blog posts are due.

It can be about what you're learning, a technical challenge you overcome, a walkthrough of something you were initially confused by, a side project you may be working on, any cool tips you've learned about anything technical, etc.

Every morning we'll have standups with the entire remote cohort and if you have a blog post due, you'll present it.

### Blog Examples

Here are some great Flatiron student blogs:

* [Koren Leslie Cohen](http://www.korenlc.com/)
* [Keith Willians](http://codewardbound.tumblr.com/)
* [Sarah Ransohoff](http://sarahunderstandsverylittle.tumblr.com/)
* [Denine Guy](http://denineguy.github.io/)
* [Tristen Siegel](http://tsiege.github.io/)
* [Kate Donahue](http://katepdonahue.tumblr.com/)
* [Oliver Switzer](http://allyourcodesarebelongtous.tumblr.com/)

## Getting Help

One of your best resource is going to be your local cohort. When you're learning together during the day, you should be working on labs together and asking each other questions. 

If you're stuck, try to work out a problem on your own. We guarantee that someone else has had a similar problem or question and you can most likely find an answer on Stack Overflow. It's super important to become self-sufficient in figuring out problems and there's incredible learning moments in that.

Yet of course we're here to help and want you to reach out if you're stuck. It sometimes makes more sense to reach out, like if there's a bug in a lab or you've been stuck for a long time. We'll be using [Handraise](http://help.flatironschool.com/), a tool we've built at Flatiron so students can ask targeted questions while working on labs and projects. Click "Get Help" and submit a Handraise ticket. Then we'll jump into the chat together or have a video chat to work through the problem. Please use Handraise as the exclusive method of communicating questions: we gather data with it that's super helpful for us when working on curriculum and thinking about points of confusion in our material.

## Going through the Curriculum

Each week, you'll be working to meet deadlines, which we'll set every Monday. Everything will be mandatory unless it's marked as bonus material. Outside of the required coursework, we'll be giving you readings from books, blogs, and other online resources. Think of these as enhancing your learning but not required.
